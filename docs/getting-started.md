# Getting started with antsibull-nox

`antsibull-nox` is a tool for testing [Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections_guide/).
Before you get started, ensure that you:

- [Create an Ansible collection](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_in_groups.html) or have a collection project available.
- Become familiar with the basics of [developing collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html).

## Adding basic tests to your collection

`antsibull-nox` defines collection tests in a `noxfile.py` file.

1. Add the following `noxfile.py` file to the root of your collection.
   The root is the directory that contains `galaxy.yml`.
1. Ensure your `galaxy.yml` file contains values for the `name` and `namespace` fields at a minimum.

```python
# The following metadata allows Python runners and nox to install the required
# dependencies for running this Python script:
#
# /// script
# dependencies = ["nox>=2025.02.09", "antsibull-nox"]
# ///

import sys

import nox


# We try to import antsibull-nox, and if that doesn't work, provide a more useful
# error message to the user.
try:
    import antsibull_nox
except ImportError:
    print("You need to install antsibull-nox in the same Python environment as nox.")
    sys.exit(1)


antsibull_nox.add_lint_sessions(
    run_isort=False,  # disable reformatting for now
    run_black=False,  # disable reformatting for now
    # Add more configuration settings here to adjust to your collection;
    # see https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/antsibull-nox/reference/#basic-linting-sessions
)
antsibull_nox.add_docs_check(
    # Add configuration settings here to adjust to your collection;
    # see https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/antsibull-nox/reference/#collection-documentation-check
)


# Allow to run the noxfile with `python noxfile.py`, `pipx run noxfile.py`, or similar.
# Requires nox >= 2025.02.09
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nox.main()
```

## Running all tests against your collection

After you add the `noxfile.py` file to your collection root, you can run the tests as follows:

1. Install `antsibull-nox`, which also installs `nox`.

    ```console
    pip install antsibull-nox
    ```

1. Run `nox` in the collection root to run all tests.

Alternatively, you do not have to install `antsibull-nox` and can run either of the following commands in the collection root:

- `pipx run noxfile.py`
- `uv run noxfile.py`

## Running specific tests against your collection

By default, nox runs all tests that you add to the `noxfile.py` file.
However, the more sessions a `nox` test suite contains, the more useful it is to run only some of the test sessions.

1. Run `nox --list` to list all available test sessions.
1. Run `nox -e <session>` to run a specific test session:

```bash
# List all test sessions
nox --list
pipx run noxfile.py --list
uv run noxfile.py --list

# Run only the 'lint' session
nox -e lint
pipx run noxfile.py -e lint
uv run noxfile.py -e lint
```

## Reusing virtual environments

For each run, `nox` recreates the virtual environment for every session.
You can re-use virtual environments in subsequent runs by passing the `-R` parameter.

```bash
# Reuse existing virtual environments
nox -R
pipx run noxfile.py -R
uv run noxfile.py -R
```

Alternatively, use a combination with the `-e` parameter:

```bash
# Run only 'lint' session and reuse existing virtual environments
nox -Re lint
pipx run noxfile.py -Re lint
uv run noxfile.py -Re lint
```

## Formatting code before commits

If present, the `formatters` session reformats Python code and should be run before a commit is made.
This session is included with the `lint` session, which takes longer because it does additional linting.

```bash
# Reformat code
nox -Re formatters
pipx run noxfile.py -Re formatters
uv run noxfile.py -Re formatters
```

!!! note
    Whether or not a collection has a `formatters` section depends on the parameters passed to `antsibull_nox.add_lint_sessions()` in the `noxfile.py` file.
    In the example in the previous section, `run_isort=False` and `run_black=False` disable both currently supported formatters.
    In this case, `antsibull-nox` does not add the `formatters` session because it would be empty.
